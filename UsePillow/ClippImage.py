Cropp an image:  
    a piece can be cut out to create a new image, using the crop() function. 
The crop function takes a tuple argument that deÔ¨Ånes the two x and y 
  coordinates of the box to crop out of the image. 
For example, if the image is 1200x12000 pixels, we can clip out a 100x100 pixel
  box in the image.
