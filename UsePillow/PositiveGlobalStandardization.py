 To maintain the pixel values in the positive domain, perhaps so the images can be
 visualized or perhaps for the beneÔ¨Åt of a chosen activation function in the 
 model. 
 A popular way of achieving this is to clip the standardized pixel values to 
 the range [-1, 1] and then rescale the values from [-1,1] to [0,1]. 
 
 The script updates the global standardization to demonstrate this additional
 rescaling.
